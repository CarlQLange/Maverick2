#basic design
The general idea comes entirely from this image.

That was actually originally an April fool's day joke about [Gunpoint](http://gunpointgame.com), an indie puzzle game. I decided to steal the idea of making a 3D third-person cover-based shooter using the 2D pixel art aesthetic so popular with indie games.

The game mechanics are pretty simple - shoot the dudes shooting at you. Make use of convenient chest-high walls. Run around with two pistols and walk away coolly from explosions.

#reasons for this design
The major advantage of doing a game like this is that asset creation should be at least somewhat simple. I hope to have to spend exactly zero hours in Blender, don't have to worry about sophisticated 3d animation, and it's a lot easier to find placeholder art.
